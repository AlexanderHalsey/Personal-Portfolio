<h3>Skills</h3>
	<h4>Technical</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Problem-solving Skills, Specific Engineering Understanding, Numerical Reasoning, Attention to Detail, High Spatial Awareness</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>My studies at university have helped me expand on my pre-existing aptitude for problem-solving skills in conjunction with acquiring specific engineering understanding. It has allowed me to work on theoretical and practical problems, numerical reasoning and data analytics. I have consequentially established proficient skills in Excel, Python and SQL along with all their technical features, confirming my propensity for meticulous attention to detail.</p>
	<h4>Customer Oriented</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Personable, Team Player, Articulate, Level-headed, Patient, Efficient, Resourceful</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Having had over three years experience in the hospitality industry, I have earned the intrinsic reward of effectively connecting with clients in a professional yet personable demeanour. It has also allowed me to create tight bonds with my co-workers and conduct collaborative work in fluid fashion. I believe I am able to articulate and present my ideas in a concise manner, and I’ve also been told my peers that I am a very good listener, which is vital in communication as one can only be as good at giving out information as they are at receiving it, that communication works in both directions equally. Additionally, my experience in this field has demonstrated to me my ability to cope well under pressure, as it has come often and in varied circumstances, such as keeping customers happy, appeasing those who weren’t, undertaking multiple tasks on busy shifts, keeping composed and professional at all times for the sake of efficiency. I am efficient and resourceful which is good for time-management and fast-paced environments, but I am also patient and calm which is good for stress-management.<p>
